# ProjectThree-ChrisBlair
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was a Grocery List program that used C++ and Python to read in a text file of all Grocery items and perform certain functions. 
The functions were: 
  1. Count the number of times each item was included in the file.
  2. Search for a specfic item and list how many times it was listed in the file.
  3. Create a histogram of the data and display it within the program using a .dat file. 
  
What did you do particularly well?

  I believe a did a fairly good job of organizing all of the functions in a way that it only served one main purpose and was easy to read and understand. 
  I also believe I used comments effectively so that readers can comprehend what is going on. 
  Most importantly the program functions as intended with no glaring errors or bugs. 
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  I could have done a better job with the creativity side of things, like making the histogram more pleasing to the eye and the formatting of some of the output text. 
  Although I do believe the code is fairly well organized, I believe I could have done a better job of creating helper functions to reduce re-written code and to create a more seamless experience. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I think the most challenging part for me was the actual file reading and manipulation. I have some experience doing this with Python at my current job, but none (outisde of this class) doing so in C++
  Input validation is also another challenging aspect. I have to remind myself that the people that would potentially use this code did NOT build it and don't know exactly how it functions and keep that in mind while I'm building.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  I believe the aspect of combining two programming languages together will be a big part of work that I do in the future. 
  I also think that reading/writing files will be a huge help, like I said I have done this some with Python in the past and believe that I will continue to do so in the future. 
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  I think having both C++ and Python together makes the program somewhat adaptable. Anything that C++ can't do, Python can and vice-versa. 
  I also believe the way that I have structured the main output functions in C++ will make it so that adding/removing functionality will be easier. 
  Using well-named variables so that people reading the code will be able to understand what is happening is a part portion of readablility and I believe I have done that well in this program.
